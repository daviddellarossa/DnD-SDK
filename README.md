# D&D SDK for Unity

A modular and extensible SDK for implementing **Dungeons & Dragons-style RPG mechanics** in Unity.

> This project is intended **exclusively for educational and non-commercial purposes**.  
> It is a **coding exercise** aimed at exploring how D&D rules can be modeled and implemented in C# and Unity.

## Purpose

This SDK is a personal and didactic project focused on:

- Learning and experimenting with **D&D 5e mechanics** through programming.
- Practicing **software design** in Unity using clean, modular architecture.
- Exploring how to represent game logic using **ScriptableObjects, data-driven systems, and object-oriented design**.
- Sharing a useful resource for others who wish to study or experiment with RPG system development.

It is **not** meant to be a full game or a finished toolset, but rather a **learning sandbox**.

## Features

- Species and Races implemented via ScriptableObjects
- Dice rolling and modifiers
- Ability scores and derived stats
- Modular combat-related components (in progress)
- Expandable framework for spells, classes, feats, etc.
- Unity 6 compatible
